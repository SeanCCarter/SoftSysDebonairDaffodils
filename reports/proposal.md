Project goals:

We aim to create an image editing program of the caliber of Microsoft Paint. Our minimum viable product is a program that can open an image file/create an empty image in the form of a bitmap, let the user edit the image with mouse input, and save the resulting image. We would like to enhance this by adding new tool options (e.g. , colors, image formatting) with an input API that could then be attached to a GUI, etc. We are most interested in image manipulation tools, rather than building the perfect GUI.
