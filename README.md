## About Sketchy-Sketch

We aim to bring some of the basic fucntionality of [MS Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) to the world of Linux. The most essential features are the ability to open a blank image, add shapes of various colors to it, and then save the image again. We also used this project as an oportunity to explore the fascinating world of low-level graphics in C.

### Background

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SeanCCarter/SoftSysDebonairDaffodils/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
