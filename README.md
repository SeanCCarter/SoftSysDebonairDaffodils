## About Sketch-a-Sketch

We aim to bring some of the basic fucntionality of MS Paint to the world of Linux. The most essential features are the ability to open a blank image, add shapes of various colors to it, and then save the image again. We used this project as an oportunity to explore the fascinating world of low-level graphics in C.
